# M604AdvancedProgramming
Classwork and practice 

# Description

Beyond basic computer programming, key concepts drive the development of advanced software and everyday tools. Building on the foundation of the previous programming module,
this module introduces students to advanced programming techniques, combining theoretical
understanding with practical experience.

# Objectives

Specific objectives include
 To analyze and apply advanced programming concepts to solve complex problems.
 To design and develop efficient applications using advanced programming techniques.

# Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of the module, students will be able to
1. Evaluate business contexts that benefit from advanced programming techniques.
2. Analyze advanced programming paradigms, including object-oriented, concurrent, and
parallel programming.
3. Develop and implement advanced programming applications.

# Teaching Methods

Students will engage in learning through a series of directed study activities, lectures, and
self-study. The teaching sessions will be divided into two parts. The first part belongs to an
interactive lecture, where students learn about theoretical aspects of the presented topic. The
second part will be an interactive lab, where students will implement the presented concepts
themselves under the guidance of the tutor. Students will be also directed to online materials
for further study.
